To do this, you will create two filters first and them combine them. For the first filter, you can use Zipline's built-in factor `AverageDollarVolume()` and its method `.top()` to select the top 20 assets of average dollar volume in a 30 day-window. To get the latest close price of the `USEquityPricing` dataset you can use `USEquityPricing.close.latest`. Finally you can combine these two filters by using the logical operator `&`. "
